# Install your robot

Your Reachy is shipped already assembled and configured. It should be a matter of minutes before you start program it. 

Before turning it on, it's always safer to check if you see anything unusual, in the unlikely event it has been damaged during transport. As an example, here is a box with a black Reachy with a single arm:

If you have a doubt, do not hesitate to send us a photo.

The antennas, the power supply and other smaller parts should be located on the lower layer in the box.

## Attach the robot on its mount

On the back of the robot torso, you will find four spots to attach the robot to a pole. You can also use a specific attach system depending on your configuration.

Always make sure the robot is correctly fixed before trying to make it move!
