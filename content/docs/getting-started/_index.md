# Getting Started

You just received your Reachy and you want to start using it? You are in the right place! 

The next sections will guide you in the steps required before turning your robot on. We make a great deal of efforts to make this process as simple and quick as possible. Yet, there are still a few steps to follow which are particularly important. 

So, grab a cup of coffee (or anything else you like) and let's do it. It should take about **TODO hours**.

1. First, you will see how to assemble the different parts of Reachy together.
2. Then, you will connect to your robot.
3. You will launch its first behavior!
