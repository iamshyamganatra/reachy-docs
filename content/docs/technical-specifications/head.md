# Reachy's head specifications

Reachyâ€™s head features two cameras: one to observe its environment and another camera to focus on the task of manipulating.
The head is animated by Orbita, a unique technology developed by Pollen Robotics' R&D team. This ball joint actuator allows unpreceded dynamic and multi-directional movement.
With animated antennas, Reachy can convey many emotions to his audience.

## Cameras

2 Raspberry Pi cameras (one wide- one narrow-angle) associated with 2 optical lenses. See details on Raspberry Pi Camera module here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/camera/

## Orbita neck joint

Ball joint actuator that is composed of a parallel mechanism motorized by 3 DC Maxon motors. The control of each motor is done with a Pololu magnetic encoder and an LUOS DC motor module.

## Antennas

Antennas are removable. A system of 3 magnets (2 south and 1 north) allow to attach the antennas to the rotation axis.
