You are in the right place!\nThe next sections will guide you in the steps required before turning your robot on. We make a great deal of efforts to make this process as simple and quick as possible. Yet, there are still a few steps to follow which are particularly important.\nSo, grab a cup of coffee (or anything else you like) and let's do it. It should take about TODO hours.\n First, you will see how to assemble the different parts of Reachy together. Then, you will connect to your robot. You will launch its first behavior!

When you receive, your Reachy, the board is pre-installed with all required softwares. So, you don't have to install anything on your computer.\nThis section is meant to give you a bit more information on how things are actually working. First, you can find the Raspberry-Pi inside the trunk of the robot, as shown on this picture:\nTODO\nThen, if you want to update or re-install the system, we recommend you to rewrite the whole image. You can use etcher to burn the ISO. You will need a SD-card with at least a 16Go capacity. You can find the latest ISO here.\nBackup\nMake sure to save and copy your work as it will be lost during the re-writing!\n The image is based on the Raspbian Buster OS (desktop version). We then installed our own software, mainly a few Python packages.\nInstall on your own machine\nWe provide a pre-install Raspberry-Pi to ensure that all Reachy are shipped ready to be used and with the same configuration. Yet, if you want to use your own computer to control Reachy, or if you want to customize the Raspbian image it is possible. It is a more complex approach and requires knowledge on development environment. The whole process will soon be described in its own section.\n Connect to your Reachy What is left to configure is how you want to access your Reachy. There are a few options. You will present the most common below.\nWork directly on the robot You can directly plug a keyboard, mouse and display on the back of robot and you are good to go.\nLogin access\nThe robot comes with the default login: pi and a default password: reachy.\n TODO: image\nYou will have access to the Raspbian GUI where you will be able to configure everything you need (WiFi, ssh access, login, etc). Please, refer to the official Raspberry-Pi documentation for more information.\nAccess it via the network You can also work from your own computer and access the robot remotely. To do so, you will first need to connect the robot to your network.\nIf you already know how to connect a Raspberry-Pi, you can follow your usual procedure. The only modification from a \u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo; Raspbian is the hostname:Â reachy and the default password:Â reachy.\nLogin access\nThe robot comes with the default login: pi and a default password: reachy. Make sure to change the password if you enable remote access! Or even better, only connect using ssh key. The hostname is reachy.\n To connect to your robot, you will need to either:\n know its IP address on your network (see with your FAI or IT to get the information) use the mDNS protocol and access the robot via its hostname  More information is accessible on the Raspberry-Pi official documentation.\nUsing the IP\nssh pi@192.168.0.42 Replace 192.168.0.42 with the IP you found.\n Using ZeroConf\nssh pi@reachy.local    Note: for information on how to use ssh on your own machine, please refer to the Raspberry-Pi documentation.\nUsing Ethernet You can connect your Reachy using the ethernet socket on the back of the robot. Most configuration should work without any additional setup.\nTODO: image\nConfiguring the WiFi Configuring the WiFi on a Raspberry-Pi for the first time can be a bit tricky. Here, again we strongly recommend to follow the official guide.\nThe simplest way, by far, is to first directly connect to the board via a keyboard and display (see this section) and use the GUI to configure the WiFi.\nYou can also first connect to the board via Ethernet and configure the WiFi via ssh in command line (see this documentation).\nFinally, if none of the options are available for you, you will need to open the robot and remove the SD-card to connect it to your computer and write the wpa_supplicant.conf file.\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/reachy-docs/docs/getting-started/faq/','title':"FAQ",'content':"FAQ "});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/reachy-docs/categories/','title':"Categories",'content':""});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/reachy-docs/docs/','title':"Docs",'content':""});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/reachy-docs/','title':"Introduction",'content':"Hello, I'm Reachy!
